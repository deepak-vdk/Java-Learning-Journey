## 🔧 How to Run the Projects
Each project has a `README.md` inside its folder with specific instructions, but the general steps to run any Java program are:

1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Project-Folder-Name
   ```
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class:
   ```bash
   java FileName
   ```
